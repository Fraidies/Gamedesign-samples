"Quest of the Monoliths" prototype

Quest of the Monoliths is a puzzle game where players controll 2 statues simultaniously, a movement in any direction effects all statues on the board. The object is to navigate the statues around objects and obstacles square-by-square in order to land them on both pressure plates. The player proceeds to the next level when all statues are on their respective plates at the same time. 

I worked on this project with one other partner where we shared responsabilites for the final build of the game. I focused mostly on designing the structure of the different puzzles as well as the environment concept.

Unfortunately, I lost the project in my upgrade to Windows 10 along with many other projects I've been a part of. What you see is a screenshot I sent to my partner of a very rough and underdeveloped prototype of the camera position and environment idea. I'm including this because I was very excited to see where this game would lead, and was enthusiastic about continuing to work on it. It may not look pretty, but I like to show it off to describe what I would have done had it not been lost.
