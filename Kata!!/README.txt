"Kata!!" final build
gold 10/14/2015

"Kata!!" is a traditional sqeuence and memory game similar to Simon Says. However, in place of 4 buttons, the players will memorize a range of 3 to 12 combinations of 9 keys. Difficulty increases as the player progresses through all 8 rounds of the game.

This was a final project for Level Design II where I worked with 3 other members. (Director, artist, programmer) 

I was in charge of level design and mechanics, contributing to what the UI layout will looks like, player PoV, ramping, win / lose conditions, and all related aspects.
